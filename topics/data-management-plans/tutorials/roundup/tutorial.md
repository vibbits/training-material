## Rounding up
### Conclusion
You have almost reached the end of this course on research data management. Have a look at John-Alan Pascoe, researcher at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at Delft University of Technology, explaining the advantages he experienced after sharing his raw and derived data in the data archive of 4TU.ResearchData.

We hope you have learned a few things about data management. The following stories illustrate not only how important it is to manage your data well well but also how very much alive data management actually is.

### Where to go from here

#### [Challenges in Irreproducible Research](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552)
Special issue in *Nature*, 7 Oct 2015

There is growing alarm about results that cannot be reproduced.  Explanations include increased levels of scrutiny, complexity of experiments and statistics, and pressures on researchers. Journals, scientists, institutions and funders all have a part in tackling reproducibility. Nature has taken substantive steps to improve the transparency and robustness in what they publish, and to promote awareness within the scientific community.

#### [Data Stories in Environmental Science](https://www.dataone.org/data-stories)
Collected by DataONE

Success stories and cautionary tales from researchers related to their experiences with managing and sharing scientific research data as collected by DataONE.

### The Second life of Research Data
It's clear by now that research data are not confined to your own project -indeed, the movement towards FAIR and OPEN data is a very exciting one. One of the many initiatives that have come to the surface is the [reprohack](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/). In a nutshell, a ReproHack is aimed at assessing the reproducibility of scientific research that publicly shared code and data. For more information, please check also [Reproducibility Hackathon Netherlands](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2020-01-15-reproducibility-hackathon-netherlands-aftermath).


## Evaluation of Training
### Evaluation
We are very curious to know if this course has helped you write your Data Management Plan (DMP) and therefore kindly invite you to fill out the evaluation of this online training. This will help us to further develop this training and future learners can benefit from this. Thank you very much!
