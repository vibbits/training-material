                    <h1 class="no_toc" id="what-is-r-">What is R ?</h1>

<p>R is many things: a project, a language… 
As a <strong>project</strong>, R is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU free software project</a>. The development of R is done under the philosophy that software should be free of charge. This is good for the user, although there are some disadvantages: R comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This statement comes up on the screen every time you start R. There is no company regulating R as a product. The R project is largely an academic endeavor, and most of the contributors are statisticians, hence the sometimes incomprehensible documentation. 
As a <strong>computer language</strong> it was created to allow manipulation of data, statistical analysis and visualization. It is not easy to learn the language if you haven’t done any programming before but it is worth taking the time as it can be a very useful tool.  An enormous variety of statistical analyses are available and R allows you to produce graphs exactly as you want them with publication quality.</p>

<h3 id="good-things-about-r">Good things about R</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It’s free</li>
  <li>It works on Windows, Mac and Linux</li>
  <li>It can deal with very large datasets (compared to Excel)</li>
  <li>A lot of freedom: graphs can be produced to your own taste</li>
  <li>Supports all statistical analyses: from basic to very complex</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="bad-things-about-r">Bad things about R</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It can struggle with extremely large datasets</li>
  <li>Difficult if you don’t have any programming experience</li>
  <li>Open source: many people contribute thus consistency can be low</li>
  <li>Open source: documentation can be poor or written by/for experts</li>
  <li>Can contain  bugs and errors: packages that are widely used are probably correct, niche packages can contain errors, there is no central team assessing the quality of the code</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="installing-r">Installing R</h1>
<p>R is available on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN website</a> (Comprehensive R Archive Network]. 
It can be installed on Linux, Mac and Windows. On the top of the CRAN page is a section with <strong>Precompiled Binary Distribution</strong>: R versions you can download as an .exe file (for Windows users) and are easy to install. What you download is the basic R installation: it contains the base package and other packages considered essential enough to include in the main installation. Exact content may vary with different versions of R.
As R is constantly being updated and new versions are constantly released, it is recommended to regularly install the newest version of R.</p>

<h1 id="installing-rstudio">Installing RStudio</h1>
<p>Although you can work directly in the R editor, most people find it easier to use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>  on top of R. RStudio is free and available for Windows, Mac and Linux. You need to have R installed to run Rstudio.</p>

<h1 id="rstudio-user-interface">RStudio user interface</h1>
<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YmcEYTSN7k">video tutorial</a> on the different components of the RStudio user interface and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0Y478jOjGk">video tutorial</a> on how to use the RStudio user interface.</p>

<h3 id="the-script-editor">The script editor</h3>
<p>A script is a text file that contains all the commands you want to run. You can write and run scripts and you can also save them so next time you need to do a similar analysis you can change and re-run the script with minimal effort. An R project can contain multiple scripts. 
The script editor highlights syntax in scripts making it easy to find and prevent errors. It has many features that will help you write scripts e.g. autocompletion, find/replace, commenting.</p>

<h3 id="autocompletion">Autocompletion</h3>
<p>It supports the automatic completion of code, e.g. if you have an object named relfreq in your workspace, type rel in the script editor and it will show a list of possibilities to complete the name.</p>

<figure id="figure-1"><img src="../../images/Rautocompletion.png" alt="autocompletion" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 1:</span> Example for autocompletion</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="find-and-replace">Find and replace</h3>
<p>Find and replace can be opened using Ctrl+F.</p>

<h3 id="adding-comments-to-scripts">Adding comments to scripts</h3>
<p>In scripts you must include comments to help you remember or tell collaborators what you did. Comments are lines that start with a # symbol. This symbol tells R to ignore  this line. Comments are displayed in green.
You can comment and uncomment large selections of code using: <strong>Comment/Uncomment Lines</strong></p>

<figure id="figure-2"><img src="../../images/Rcomment_uncomment.png" alt="comment_uncomment" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 2:</span> Menu Comment/Uncomment Lines</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="adding-section-headings-to-scripts">Adding section headings to scripts</h3>
<p>Add section headings to your scripts using the following format: #Heading Name####</p>

<figure id="figure-3"><img src="../../images/Rsection_headings.png" alt="section_headings" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 3:</span> Define section headings</figcaption></figure>

<p>At the bottom of the script editor you can quickly navigate to sections in your script. Especially in long scripts this is very useful.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-new-script">Creating a new script</h3>
<p>Click <strong>File</strong> in the top menu and select <strong>New File &gt; R Script</strong>.</p>

<figure id="figure-4"><img src="../../images/Rnew_script.png" alt="new_script" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 4:</span> File Menu / New File</figcaption></figure>

<p>Besides a simple R script, there are many other file types you can create:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R markdown</a> file: incorporate R-code and its results in a report</li>
  <li>R Notebook: R Markdown file with chunks of code that can be executed interactively, with output visible beneath the code</li>
  <li>R Sweave file: incorporate R-code and its results in a Latex report</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="opening-an-existing-script">Opening an existing script</h3>
<p>Click <strong>File</strong> in the top menu and select <strong>Open File</strong>.</p>

<p>Scripts are opened as a tab in the script editor. You can open several scripts at the same time in RStudio.</p>

<h3 id="running-a-script">Running a script</h3>
<p>To run a script you select the code that you want to execute in the script editor and click the <strong>Run</strong> button at the top right of the script editor.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/Rrun_script.png" alt="run_script" /></p>

<p>The code will be executed in the console.</p>

<h3 id="saving-a-script">Saving a script</h3>

<p>If there are unsaved changes in a script, the name of the script will be red and followed by an asterisk. To save the script click the <strong>Save</strong> button: <img src="../../images/Rsave_script.png" alt="save_script" /></p>

<p>R scripts should have the extension .R 
Once it is saved the asterisk disappears and the name becomes black.</p>

<h3 id="the-console">The console</h3>
<p>The  &gt; symbol in the console shows that R is ready to execute code 
e.g. type 10+3 and press return</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; 10 + 3
[1] 13
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The result is printed in the console.</p>

<p>It is recommended to write commands in a script rather than typing them directly into the console. Creating a script makes it easier to reproduce, repeat and describe the analysis. If you select commands in the script editor and press the <strong>Run</strong> button, you will see the commands appearing in the console as they are executed.</p>

<p>If the &gt; symbol does not reappear upon execution of a command it means that R has crashed or is still calculating. To terminate a command press Esc.</p>

<p>The console also has many <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200404846-Working-in-the-Console">features that make life easier</a> like autocompletion, retrieving previous commands.</p>

<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>A list of all variables (numbers, vectors, plots, models…) that have been imported or generated. The variables that R creates and manipulates are called <em>objects</em>. 
To remove all variables that have been generated in the RStudio session:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; rm(list=ls())
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>ls() lists the objects in the current workspace and rm() removes them.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>An overview of the last 500 commands that were run in the console: see <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526217-Command-History">how to use the history</a>.</p>

<h3 id="connections">Connections</h3>
<p>An interface to easily <a href="http://db.rstudio.com/">connect to databases</a> in R.</p>

<h3 id="files">Files</h3>
<p>The list of files and folders in the working directory. RStudio has a default working directory, typically your home folder.</p>

<h3 id="changing-the-working-directory">Changing the working directory</h3>
<p>Often you want to work in the folder that contains the data. In that case you can change the working directory. 
 Check which folder R is using as a working directory:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; getwd()
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Change the working directory:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; setwd("D:/trainingen/zelfgegeven/R/")
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <h3 id="comment-comment"><i class="fa fa-commenting-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">comment</span> Comment</h3>

  <p>You need to use / or \ in paths. Either will work but \ will not since R sees it as the character that represents a division.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing your working directory will make relative file references in your code invalid so you type this in the console <strong>at the start of the analysis</strong>.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can change the working directory in the <strong>Files</strong> tab, expand <strong>More</strong> and select <strong>Set As Working Directory</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <h3 id="hands_on-hands-on-demo"><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">hands_on</span> Hands-on: Demo</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Download the demo script for this lesson and open it in RStudio
<a href="http://data.bits.vib.be/pub/trainingen/RIntro/Demo_1.R"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Demo_1.R</code></a></li>
    <li>From the demo script run the <strong>Set working directory</strong> section</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="notranslate hands_on">
  <h3 id="hands_on-hands-on-exercise-1"><i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="visually-hidden">hands_on</span> Hands-on: Exercise 1</h3>

  <p>Set the working directory to the folder that contains the demo script that you have downloaded and check if it was changed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To list the files in the working directory:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; list.files() 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="plots">Plots</h3>
<p>Plots that are generated by the code you run will appear here.
To save a plot click the <strong>Export</strong> button: <img src="../../images/Rexport_plot.png" alt="export_plot" /></p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>R is popular because of the enormous diversity of packages. R is essentially a modular environment and you install and load the modules (packages) you need. Packages are available at the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">CRAN</a> and <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html">Bioconductor</a> websites. 
Installing a package means that a copy of the package is downloaded and unzipped on your computer. If you want to know in what directory R stores the packages, type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;.libPaths()
[1] "D:/R-3.6.0/library"
&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>to see the default path where R stores packages. If you want to change this folder use the <em>destdir</em> argument of the install.packages() function:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; install.packages("car",destdir="C:/Users/Janick/R")
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You only need to install a package once, as it is saved on your computer.</p>

<h3 id="installing-r-packages">Installing R packages</h3>
<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1r5XTqrCTQ">video tutorial</a> on how to install CRAN packages. 
When you have made changes to the right side of the Rstudio user interface (packages, files tab…), R is sometimes slow to show these changes. In that case hit the refresh button: <img src="../../images/Rrefresh_button.png" alt="refresh_button" /></p>

<p>Some packages are not available on the CRAN site. Download in compressed format (as a .zip or .tar.gz file) from the source site. To install: select <strong>Install from Package Archive File (.zip; .tar.gz)</strong> in the <strong>Install Packages</strong> window and R will put it in the appropriate directory.</p>

<figure id="figure-5"><img src="../../images/Rinstall_zip.png" alt="install_zip" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 5:</span> Installing packages downloaded from their source site</figcaption></figure>

<h3 id="installing-bioconductor-packages">Installing Bioconductor packages</h3>
<p>Bioconductor is a set of R packages that provides tools for the analysis of high-throughput data, e.g. NGS data.
Make sure you have the BiocManager package installed:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager")) 
install.packages("BiocManager") 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The if statement is checking if you already have the BiocManager package installed, if not then install.packages() will install it. BiocManager is a package to install and update Bioconductor packages. Once BiocManager is installed, you can install the Bioconductor core packages:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; BiocManager::install()
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To install additional Bioconductor packages e.g. <strong>GenomicFeatures</strong> you type the following command:</p>

<h3 id="installing-packages-from-github">Installing packages from GitHub</h3>
<p>Git is a free and open source version control system. Version control helps software developers manage changes to code by keeping track of every change in a special database. If a mistake is made, the developer can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to fix the mistake. 
There is an install_github() function in the devtools packageto install R packages hosted on GitHub:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; install.packages("devtools") 
&gt; library(devtools)
&gt; devtools::install_github("statOmics/MSqRob&amp;copy;MSqRob0.7.6")
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="loading-packages">Loading packages</h3>
<p>Each time you want to use a package you have to load it (activate its functions). Loading a package is done by selecting it in the list of installed packages or by typing the following command:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; library("name_of_package")
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If R responds:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Error in library(car) : there is no package called 'car'
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or similar, it means that the car package needs to be installed first.</p>

<h3 id="help">Help</h3>
<p>You can find a lot of documentation online: e.g. the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/help.html">getting help section</a> of the R website. R documentation is not easily accessible nor well-structured  so it can be a challenge to consult the help files of R packages online. By far the most user-friendly interface for searching the R documentation is the <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/">Rdocumentation website</a>.

<figure id="figure-6"><img src="../../images/Rarithmetic_operators.png" alt="arithmetic_operators" /><figcaption><span class="figcaption-prefix">Figure 6:</span> Overview of arithmetic operators</figcaption></figure>

<p>Arithmetic operators follow the standard <strong>order of priority</strong>, with exponentiation the highest and addition and subtraction the lowest priority, but you can control the order with <strong>parentheses</strong>. Do not use brackets as these are for other purposes in R.</p>

<h3 id="logical-operators">Logical operators</h3>
<p>Logical operators can be used to selectively execute code based on certain conditions. They allow to create logical expressions (comparisons) that return TRUE or FALSE.</p>

<h1 id="assigning-variables">Assigning variables</h1>
<p>A variable allows you to save a value or an object (a plot, a table, a list of values) in R. 
A value or object is assigned to a variable by the assignment operator <strong>&lt;-</strong>
It consists of the two characters &lt; (less than) and - (minus):</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; v &lt;- 4	now the value of variable v is 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In most contexts the = operator can be used as an alternative:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; v &lt;- 4 
&gt; v = 4 
give the same result: a variable called v with value 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>After R has performed the assignment you will not see any output, as the value 4 has been saved to variable v. You can access and use this variable at any time and print its value in the console by running its name:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; v
[1] 4
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can now use v in expressions instead of 4</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; v * v
[1] 16
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can re-assign a new value to a variable at any time:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; v &lt;- "a cool variable"
&gt; v
[1] "a cool variable"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>R is not very fussy as far as syntax goes. Variable names can be anything, though they cannot begin with a number or symbol. Informative names often involve using more than one word. Providing there are <strong>no spaces</strong> between these words you can join them using dots, underscores and capital letters though the Google R style guide recommends that names are joined with a dot.</p>

<h3 id="using-operators-to-create-variables">Using operators to create variables</h3>
<p>You can combine variables into a new one using operators (like + or /).</p>

<h3 id="using-functions-to-create-variables">Using functions to create variables</h3>
<p>A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task. 
Functions are called by another line of code that sends a request to the function to do something or return a variable. The call may pass <em>arguments</em> (inputs) to the function. In other words a function allows you to combine variables (arguments) into a new variable (returned variable).
There are lots of built in functions in R and you can also write your own. Even the base package supplies a large number of pre-written functions to use. Other packages are filled with additional functions for related tasks.
Calling a function in R has a certain syntax:
<strong>output &lt;- function(list of arguments)</strong> 
For example:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; p &lt;-  ggplot(mtcars,(aes(wt,mpg))
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>In this example <strong>ggplot()</strong> is the <strong>function</strong>. The brackets () are always needed. Before a function can start the actions and calculations  it encodes, it needs prior information: <strong>input</strong> data and parameter settings. These are called the <strong>arguments</strong> of the function. In this example the arguments are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>mtcars</strong>: a table containing the input data</li>
  <li><strong>aes(wt,mpg)</strong>: defines the two columns of the table you want to plot: weight (wt) along the X-axis and miles/gallon (mpg) along the Y-axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see the arguments of a function you can use <strong>?</strong> or <strong>help()</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt; ? ggplot 
&gt; help(ggplot)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This opens the documentation of the function in the <strong>Help</strong> tab including an overview of the arguments of the function. At the bottom of the documentation page you find examples on how to use the function.
The function generates a plot so the plot <strong>p</strong> is the <strong>output</strong> of the function.</p>

<p>Sometimes functions from different packages have the same name. In that case use <strong>package::function</strong> to specify the package you want to use, e.g. ggplot2::ggplot() where ggplot2 is the name of the package and ggplot() is the name of the function.</p>
